- **Publication:** Publish the landing page to push it live
- **Expiration/Depublication:** Unpublish manually or wait for the landing page to expire

#### Landing Pages Templates

#### Landing Page Structure
The structure consists of three pages:

Developers can create custom landing page templates with custom configuration and design requirements.

- Profile acquisition can link to a service

Select the service using one of these options:

#### Confirmation Messages
You can send confirmation messages from a landing page, as well as a service.  By default:

If a landing page **is not** linked to a service, you might want to enable the sending of confirmation messages - for example, with the profile acquisition use case.

Sending these messages requires a transactional message template.

If a landing page is linked to a service, enable messages only if the linked service is not sending confirmation messages.
